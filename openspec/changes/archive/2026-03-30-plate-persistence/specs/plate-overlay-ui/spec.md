## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Add a manual plate box
The system SHALL allow the user to add a new bounding box on the current frame. The new box SHALL be pre-populated with the position and size of the nearest prior detected plate (searching backward in frame order). If no prior detection exists, a default centered box SHALL be used. After adding the box, the system SHALL auto-save all plate data to the sidecar file.

#### Scenario: Add box with prior detection available
- **WHEN** the user triggers "Add plate box" and frame 50 has a detected plate but frames 51-55 do not, and the current frame is 55
- **THEN** a new box SHALL be created at frame 55 with the same position and size as the plate from frame 50, marked as `manual: true`

#### Scenario: Add box with no prior detection
- **WHEN** the user triggers "Add plate box" and no prior frames have any detections
- **THEN** a new box SHALL be created at the center of the frame with a default size (15% of frame width, 5% of frame height), marked as `manual: true`

#### Scenario: Added box is immediately editable
- **WHEN** a manual box is added
- **THEN** the new box SHALL be automatically selected, ready for move/resize

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Display plate data persistence status
The system SHALL display a visual indicator in the plate controls area showing whether saved plate data was loaded from disk for the current video.

#### Scenario: Plates loaded from disk
- **WHEN** plate data is successfully loaded from a sidecar file
- **THEN** a status label SHALL display "Plates loaded from disk" or similar message

#### Scenario: No saved plates
- **WHEN** no sidecar file exists or plate data is empty
- **THEN** no persistence status indicator SHALL be displayed

### Requirement: Clear saved plates button
The system SHALL provide a "Clear Saved Plates" button in the plate controls area. The button SHALL be enabled only when plate data exists (in memory or on disk).

#### Scenario: Click clear saved plates
- **WHEN** the user clicks "Clear Saved Plates"
- **THEN** the system SHALL delete the sidecar file, clear in-memory plate data, hide the plate overlay, and update the status indicator

#### Scenario: Button disabled when no data
- **WHEN** no plate data exists in memory and no sidecar file exists on disk
- **THEN** the "Clear Saved Plates" button SHALL be disabled
